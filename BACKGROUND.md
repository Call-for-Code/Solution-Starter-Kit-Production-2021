# Responsible production and consumption background information

## Overview

Worldwide economic production and consumption rest on the use of the natural environment and resources in a way that continues to have destructive impacts on the planet. Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development depends.

The United Nations has established Sustainable Development [Goal 12](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) to help ensure the world moves towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. This goal is about systemic change, decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation and applying a lifecycle thinking approach, taking into account all phases of resource use to do more and better with less. It is also about increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles. It can also contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and the transition towards low-carbon and green economies. Production and consumption of goods and services should drive economic growth and improve quality of life, but with fewer natural resources and less environmental impact across the life cycle.

## Statistics to consider

- Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices. [United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/)
- If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save $120 billion USD annually. [United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/)
- Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. [United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/)
- The Global Material Footprint has moved from 73.2 billion tons in 2010 to 85.9 billion tons in 2017. [United Nations Department of Economic & Social Affairs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12)
- From 2010-2019, electronic waste grew by 38%, but less than 20% is recycled. [United Nations Department of Economic & Social Affairs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12)
- Between 2014 - 2025, the estimated growth in the sharing economy is $321 billion. [One Planet](https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/about/what-Sustainable-Consumption-Production)

## Targets of [UN Sustainable Goal #12]()

- Implement the 10-year framework of programs on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries
- By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
- By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses
- By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water, and soil to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment
- By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse
- By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature
- Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production

## How technology can help

Technology can help in many ways, from recommendations on energy efficiency to highlighting the carbon footprint of online purchases.

For example, the [Plastic Bank](https://plasticbank.com/) leverages blockchain and [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) technologies to create an application that helps monetize ocean plastic. The problem of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans has gained increasing visibility of late. Although rising awareness is a positive, it’s done little to curb the root of the problem, the estimated eight million metric tons of plastics that go into the oceans every year. Plastic Bank has the vision to set up recycling systems in economically disadvantaged parts of the world that would enable local citizens to monetize plastic pollution. Plastic Bank developed a security-rich, scalable reward system—a blockchain banking platform—that runs on IBM Cloud.

Recycling and recovery: One of the more pressing challenges in addressing waste and shifting to a more circular economy is the increasing complexity of products. For example, electronics are getting smaller and more sophisticated, making recovery and reuse of materials more challenging. Product designers must consider how to create products with end of life in mind (for example, fewer components), and we need to develop the infrastructure, policies, and systems to support repair, reuse, and recycling.
